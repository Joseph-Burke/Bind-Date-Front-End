# Chez Toi: App

"**Chez Toi**" is an application for browsing and booking viewings for houses. It interacts with the [Chez Toi API](https://github.com/Joseph-Burke/Chez-Toi-API) to provide users with up-to-date information on the houses that are available and the viewings that the user has booked.

<!-- ![screenshot](./screenshots/screenshot-main.png)

The website consists of several pages:

1) The "House Browser" page, where the user may view look through images and brief descriptions for the houses available for viewing and access the "House Details" page for any house that interests them.

2) The "House Details" page, where a user can view further information about the selected house and access a form to book a viewing at that house if they choose.

3) The "Viewings" page, where a user can see all the viewings that they have booked so far, and cancel any if they wish.

4) The "Sign Up" page, where a user can create a new account - this is required in order to book a viewing.

5) The "Log In" page, where a user can log in to an existing account using their e-mail address.
